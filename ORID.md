# O
I have learnt the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including its three main features: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. I have also learnt how to conduct retrospective meetings and understand their importance.

# R
I think that adopting OOP design patterns in Java coding is quite important. I also believe that holding retrospective meetings is beneficial to projects.

# I
By understanding and applying OOP principles, I can write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. Retrospective meetings help teams reflect on their processes, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall project efficiency.

# D
Moving forward, I will integrate OOP design patterns into my Java projects to improve code quality. Additionally, I will ensure that retrospective meetings are a regular part of my team's workflow to continuously improve our project management practices.
